# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Computer Science.
- I am taking STATS 220 because I did STATS 20X last semester and would like to continue learning more.
- I am interested in learning about R and familiarising myself with the ways to understand data.

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![]([https://c.tenor.com/8druEACXtX8AAAAd/tenor.gif](https://tenor.com/view/jinki948-cat-thinking-lay-down-lying-down-gif-22585363)
