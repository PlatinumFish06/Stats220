# stats220

I am currently on my *last* year of my **computer science** degree. This is my repo for STATS 220. 

### Statistic and me:

- I am taking STATS 220 because I did STATS 20X last semester and would like to continue learning more.
- I am interested in learning about R and familiarising myself with the ways to understand data.

### My favourite artists:

1. Yorushika
2. Zutomayo
3. R Sound Design
